/// Letâ€™s say you have n doors that start out as closed. With the first pass across the doors,
/// you toggle every door open. With the second pass, you toggle every second door.
/// With the third, every third door, and so on.
///
/// Write a function that takes in an integer numberOfPasses,
/// and returns how many doors are open after the number of passes.
